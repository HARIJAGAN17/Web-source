        <h1>Apple</h1>
        <p>The apple, scientifically known as Malus domestica, is one of the most widely cultivated fruit trees globally and a member of the rose family. Originating in Central Asia, specifically Kazakhstan, the apple has been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and was brought to North America by European colonists. Apples come in a variety of shades, including red, green, and yellow, each variety offering distinct flavors, textures, and culinary uses. They are rich in fiber, vitamin C, and various antioxidants, making them highly beneficial for heart health, weight management, and reducing the risk of several chronic diseases. Apple orchards are particularly famous for their blossoms that provide spectacular views in spring before the fruit ripens in the fall.</p>

        <h1>Mango</h1>
        <p>Mangoes, referred to as the "king of fruits" in many parts of the world, are native to South Asia and have been cultivated by humans for over 4,000 years. Known scientifically as Mangifera indica, this tropical fruit thrives in warm climates and is now grown in many frost-free tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Mangoes are distinguished by their rich, juicy pulp that ranges from sweet to tart, enveloped in a thick skin which can be green, yellow, or red based on the variety and ripeness. They are a nutrient powerhouse, packed with vitamins A and C, fiber, and over a dozen different types of polyphenols, including mangiferin, which is especially powerful. Mangoes are versatile in use, eaten raw, blended into smoothies, or cooked in both sweet and savory dishes.</p>

        <h1>Orange</h1>
        <p>Oranges are among the most popular fruits around the world and belong to the Citrus genus. They likely originated in ancient China and are now grown in most warm regions of the world, especially in Florida and California in the USA, parts of the Mediterranean, and Brazil, which is the largest producer of oranges globally. Oranges are categorized into two main types: sweet oranges (Citrus sinensis) and bitter oranges (Citrus aurantium). Rich in vitamin C, oranges are known for their health benefits, including boosting the immune system, reducing the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and cancer, and promoting clear, healthy skin. Oranges are consumed fresh, juiced, and are also popularly used in cooking and baking.</p>
